### StreamingFast Firehose Bitcoin Types

Protobuf definitions when dealing with Firehose Bitcoin chain.

Foremost, this provides [sf.bitcoin.types.v1.Block](https://buf.build/streamingfast/firehose-bitcoin/docs/main:sf.bitcoin.type.v1#sf.bitcoin.type.v1.Block) which is used for consuming Firehose & Substreams Bitcoin block model.

This is probably the only model you should really care about, the rest are meant for internal communications for Firehose operators.
